/* there are 3 types of to set a variable
var, let and const.
the difference is var is a old type to declare a variable and let is a new type to declare a variable and const 
is a variable that never change the value like const name = 'Carlos' */


var nome = 'Carlos'
console.log(nome)

let nome2 = 'carlos2'
console.log(nome2)

const NOME3 = 'carlos3' 
console.log(NOME3)

/* variables cant have the same name and  variables are sensitive i means if u set the variable with the name 

let yourage = 20 and u call Yourage u'll got a error because the difference and yourname and Yourname*/

/* and normaly const are set with uppercase  */
