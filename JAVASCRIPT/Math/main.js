/*
    The Math.random() static method returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number that's 
    greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1, with approximately uniform distribution 
    over that range â€” which you can then scale to your desired range. 
    The implementation selects the initial seed to the random number generation algorithm; 
    it cannot be chosen or reset by the user.
